# CHOPR 102: Intro to Stats in R
Materials for the Intro to Stats in R talk for CHOP R User Group 2021-10-27

## Description:

**Intro to Stats in R** (Rose Hartman, Arcus Education DBHi)

In this meeting, we’ll take a look at how to get started with :star2: statistical analysis in R. :star2: This is what you might call R 102 --- I’ll assume you have had a little exposure to R before, such as by attending an Intro to R workshop, but otherwise this will be geared toward beginners. We’ll go over three popular statistical tests (t-tests, linear regression, and logistic regression), their code, and their output. I’ll also show you how to generalize what you learn to other kinds of statistical tests in R, including taking a peak at how to use the powerful and flexible “model objects” R creates when you run statistical tests. Finally, I’ll give you some tools to convert your output into lovely, presentable results tables in an R Markdown document.
